2. Analyzed trends based on age group, department, job role, education field, and travel frequency, helping HR leadership make data-driven decisions.

3. Integrated custom KPIs, conditional formatting, and drill-down visuals to identify high-risk attrition segments and correlate with factors like overtime, job involvement, and environment satisfaction.

4. Used DAX measures to create dynamic insights on attrition rates by department and gender, and calculated metrics such as average salary hike, years at company, and training investment efficiency.

5. Optimized dashboard performance with slicers and filters, enabling HR teams to segment data by age group, business travel, and job level to proactively manage talent retention strategies.
